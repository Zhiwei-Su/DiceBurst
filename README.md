# Dice Burst
This is one of our favourite family dice games. In this game, the player just only need 5 dices and it is a two or more players game. The Player can only score on a roll that dice do not contain the numbers 1 and 6. Any dice showing 1 or 6 will be a "Dice Burst"! The purpose of the game is the player try to get the highest score.

# Materials:
1) 5 dices 
2) Paper and pencil


# How to play
1) Each player rolls one dice and sets the highest score as the rounds. 

2) The player starts to roll 5 dice. If any dice shows 1 or 6, the player will not score for this dice. And except the dice showing the number 1 or 6, the player gets a total score from adding up the total number of dices.

3) Lays up the dice showing 1 and 6 dice as the "Dice Burst", and then rolls  the rest dices. Similarly, the player just does not get the points from the dices showing the number 1 or 6.

4) Keep going in this way until all the dices are "Dice Burst". Mark down the player score, and pass the dice to the next player.
